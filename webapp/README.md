# React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running locally

```
$ npm install
```

Go to webapp/src/constants/index.js and uncomment line number 2, which lets it connect to the local backend server.

```
$ npm start
```

This should start up the app and open the browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/)
